*Enjoy Nintendo with Ant & Dec* was a content ‘hub’ of the GAME website, produced to support Nintendo’s multi-million pound ad campaign. Built to a tight deadline, against strict brand guidelines from Nintendo and the use of the Ant and Dec’s imagery. 

Featuring strong visual ties with Nintendo’s marketing campaign, the design also visually emulates the game consoles hardware buttons. 

This composite image shows the various tabs of the hub. These promotional panels displayed above each featured product category.
