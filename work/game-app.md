Because of my interest in the mobile web and applications, I was tasked to design icons for the UI and in-app banners for GAME’s first iOS application.

The new platform nature of the project meant it was essential to keep ‘on brand’ with the look and feel of the GAME store to reassure users they would receive the same customer experience as with the GAME site.

Whilst the app didn’t use a more common app-type navigation (links list or icon grid), the app regularly received comments on its ease of navigation, which I feel I contributed a part of that visual language.

_As of ~<time datetime="2012-10">Oct 2012</time> the GAME app is no longer available for download in the form shown here._
