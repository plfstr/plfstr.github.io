Print Theme is my first publicly released theme for the Tumblr platform. It draws its inspiration from the <abbr title="Cyan Magenta Yellow Key(Black)">CMYK</abbr> colour blocks you see at the edge of printed material. I thought it would appeal to the creative bias of Tumblr users, with a graphical style I had not seen on other themes. 

I noticed that many Tumblr themes sacrificed quality markup and accessibility for presentation. To ensure the best experience for all users I included HTML5 semantic markup, accessibility, international language support, while putting the content first and allowing theme customisation.

## Features

*	HTML5 semantic markup
*	Multi-language support
*	Typographic grid
*	Custom CSS support
*	`@media print` styles

For more info about the themes features and customisation options available, see my [Print Theme page](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/printtheme) for more details. Print Theme can be found [on the Tumblr Theme Garden](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/30839).

## Response

The theme achieved 200+ installs within its first <time datetime="P7D">7 days</time> available and peaked at **450+ installs**.

I also posted a follow-up of the [theme progress](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/print-theme-update/) and the lessons learned during its development, submission and release. All [Print Theme](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/printtheme) posts are tagged [#printtheme](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/tag/printtheme/).
