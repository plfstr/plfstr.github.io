Tasked with creating a downloadable and printable measuring tape for Ideal World customers to measure themselves, establish their size and assist in placing jewellery orders.

### Deliverables

*	Incredibly accurate measurements required to avoid disappointed customers.
*	Precise and simple instructions and uncluttered design.
*	Sparing use of colour to keep customers print time quick and light on ink use.

The ring size guide I designed is as accurate as the tape that Goldsmiths distribute through their website and was available for customers to download from 2008â€“2016 on the Ideal World website.
