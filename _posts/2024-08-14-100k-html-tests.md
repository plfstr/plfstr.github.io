**How many&#8253;** That was the question [where HTML Memory Test started](/blog/html-elements-test/):

Now I'm saying it again as **100,000 people have now tested themselves** over [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/zYqQeRw).

It’s not long since the [50k milestone](/blog/50k-mem-test-views/), but the [places the quiz has featured](/blog/html-memory-tested/#sites-featured) featured keeps growing - including the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40968520) and the front page of CodePen, which caused a crowd of people to the test. 

It’s not the first time [I accidentally started a thing](/blog/css1k-on-codepen/) on CodePen, or [showing my working](/blog/show-your-working/) was more popular than [my other coding projects](https://codepen.io/plfstr). 

## Test Yourself

I am amazed at how popular the little test has been! I still enjoy seeing people sharing their scores and remembering the HTML tags they had forgotten about. Me too. [How many HTML tags can you remember?](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/zYqQeRw)

There are other forks by other developers for you to test the rest of your web knowledge:

+ Pre-HTML5 [Obsolete & Deprecated HTML Tags Memory Test](https://codepen.io/knowler/full/eYwpWdv).
+ A [CSS version](https://codepen.io/bramus/full/rNMbOxz) of 650+ properties!
+ How about a [CSS Units game](https://www.projectwallace.com/css-units-game)?
