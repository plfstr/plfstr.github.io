**Having made a few single-serve Pens, such as [Colordinates](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/rarJov) and [Embriage Ipsum](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/zxdYpb). I began [a collection of app-like pens](https://codepen.io/collection/ANqGVk/), simple Pens with a single purpose.**

Some could form part of your workflow, comparing fonts with Typeface Comparison

Some are practical and well executed such as this Pomodoro Timer

Some are simple fun, such as Paint 2016

Just pass some time with Memory Game

[Pen Apps Collection](https://codepen.io/plfstr/post/pen-apps-collection) is 35+ pens so far, with more added when they are found. Check out the collection, find somethign[sic] you can use, or inspires you to build something.
