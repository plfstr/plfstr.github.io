Another year on the World Wide Web. Let's summarise what I _vibe_ did.

## PFD

Nothing notable this year but rather 50+ tiny tweaks, including:

* PF logo refactored 50% smaller via path `use` for the drop shadow.
* Homepage grid given a forgotten about refactor via `display: contents` instead of nested grids.


## Projects

You are never bored with web projects. The web keeps adding features and I keep finding places they could work.

* [Brush Swap](/blog/brush-swap/) date calculations refactored from Day.js to native Temporal dates! Toothpaste [swoops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste#:~:text=called%20a%20%22nurdle%22) details created via the new CSS `shape()` property and the paste stripes used the new CSS `@function` to multiply margin variables.
* [Elitricity](/blog/elitricity/) moved away from CSS grid, to use [`text-wrap: balance`](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/10/you-can-use-text-wrap-balance-on-icons/) instead for its nice centering. Grid carbon intensity data now fetched async, with an `AbortController` so it can timeout.
* [Hnue](/blog/year-review-2023/#:~:text=I%20built%20HNue%20app,reading%20experience) was almost completely refactored to be more concise.

## CodePens
* Solution (with issues) for [one-time password box](https://codepen.io/plfstr/full/ogvrVbM) for [Frontend Masters challenge](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/html-css-for-a-one-time-password-input/).
* HTML Memory Test passed 110k views!

So that was my 2025! Thanks for reading.
