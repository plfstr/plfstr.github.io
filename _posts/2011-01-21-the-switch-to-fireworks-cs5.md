I have recently [made the switch](/blog/switch-to-fireworks-cs5/) from a longtime user of Photoshop [7 years] to Fireworks CS5.

Articles like these turned me around to the idea and the more I looked the more sensible it seemed to become:

* [7 reasons why I chose Fireworks over Photoshop](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/08/7-reasons-why-i-choose-fireworks-over-photoshop/) [webdesignerdepot]
* [50 reasons NOT to use Photoshop for Web Design](http://www.reinegger.net/50_reasons_not_to_use_photoshop_for_webdesign.html) [reinegger.net]

So read on about my experience so far with Fireworks CS5…

This isn’t a guide to Fireworks CS5, it is simply my impression of the programme as I used it [in no particular order] and my opinion of it now. It’s not a straight out Photoshop vs Fireworks grudge match but you may learn some pitfalls and hopefully avoid them if you come to use it. No promises though.

There are quite a few sections I have commented about so you can jump to them from here:

* [Batch Processing](#Batch%20Processing)
* [Vector Drawing](#Vector%20Drawing)
* [Site Export](#Site%20Export)
* [Other Issues](#Small%20Issues)
* [Roundup](#Round%20Up)

I was feeling creatively challenged when I first fired Fireworks up so I decided to set up some batch processing actions needed imminently for a gallery page I help maintain. It’s is a linear process it should show any differences pretty obviously.

## Batch Processing

Now if this were Photoshop[Ps] I would go through the motions as an action, record it, then use that action in the batch processing tool setup. Confusingly, Fireworks[Fw] refers to this as scripting, commands and later on as actions, in the help section. I muddled on and made it all the way through creating the process for resizing, optimising and exporting, and moved to set up my first batch using my saved ‘command’. At the point I was looking for the option to pre-pend ‘thumb_’ to my newly batched output, I realised you can set up all the most common batching steps from the batch tool itself. Resize, optimise and appending to filenames are all available in the batch processing panel itself.

This is great plus for bespoke one off batches or short runs of a couple of images, whereas the process of recording it in Ps can in some cases take longer than manually doing it yourself. This was a surprise and a good start.

More about Fireworks batch processing is covered in this article on [Webdesign Tuts](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/videos/fireworks-videos/getting-started-with-fireworks-batch-processing-experiment/).

## Vector Drawing

![Fireworks CS5 box vector illustration](/assets/images/fireworks-cs5-box.png)

As a quick demo I drew a Fireworks CS5 box drawn as vector in Fireworks.

I am used to creating vectors in Ps. My main hangup in Fw at first was the fact that you can’t grab the path between two points and drag them as you can in Photoshop, you have to drag using a point – I know that is a small point but a change in behaviour. I found it a little more clunky in general at first, the are many more tools for manipulation and selection of points – everything is delineated out and feels like much button pressing is going on than working directly with the paths.

Being able to save assets as universal symbols is certainly handy, and saving colour themes and styles. With my background in corporate workplaces this feature would have been welcome in the past for use amongst the teams.

Being able to wrap text inside vector shapes is great for demonstrating copy flowing around images in articles etc. That’s going to come in handy.

The ability to create dotted dividers is a much more simple process as there are dotted borders for vector shapes. As I remember, I used to have to create a hard-edge brush in Ps with a large percentage spacing to achieve that effect, and it was raster as well so editing it was a pain. In Fw you can use vector, and therefore column width changes are no sweat.

Also non-destructive filter effects!

## Site Export

I haven’t had a chance to use the export site in anger yet, but from the trial I had with it looks like it is a great way to fire off a design to a client for sign-off before build. The markup isn’t quite as div-tastic as I was prepared for and the CSS is on the heavy side but not overly excessive. I certainly feel better sending a div based markup than the overzealous table based markup I thought Fw would produce. It feels good to hit the export button and have a multipage prototype in a matter of seconds to click around on, very satisfying.

I like the ability to establish font styles at the design level and have Fw export them out as CSS.

## Small Issues

* Opacity and layer overlays is handled at the layer level. You can’t for example change the opacity of a stroke or the blend mode of a texture independently as you can with Ps.
* Annoyingly the cursor vanishes when I am selecting around inside text to correct a spelling for example, it becomes a memory counting game to where the cursor will reappear.
* Value input box for JPEG quality in the optimisation panel has disappeared a couple of times, it’s still there you just can’t see it.

## Round Up

I am wary that the above findings may come across as negatively biased. I hope you appreciate that it is easier to look for things you know, they raise more of a flag when they aren’t there, the differences are easy to spot when they trip you a little. So far I don’t feel like is going to compromise my work output and the quality, the points above are small and to be expected with that in mind. Price was a consideration and I have to remember I saved nearly £400 [$620ish] compared to the box price of Photoshop so it is to be expected that there will be compromises in the software and tweaks needed to my design approach. I don’t feel I do enough freelance to offset the box price of Photoshop but I do believe this is the best solution for me and the best platform for prototyping websites, I can’t wait to try a project from start to finish.

I would definitely recommend you make the best use of the 30 day trial, I don’t feel I did and it would have cleared up a lot of these smaller surprise issues. Make some small test projects and test out all the techniques and tools you like to use and get a feel of how you can accomplish them in Fireworks. With the use of a well known search engine I have been able to find sources that have easily answered any issues I have encountered, so it’s not a problem to find assistance. I’ll keep you posted of future Fireworks projects. **Thanks for reading**.
