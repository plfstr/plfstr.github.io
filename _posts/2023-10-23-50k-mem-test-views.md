[HTML Memory Test](/blog/html-elements-test/), my enlightening/infuriating test, has passed 50,000+ views on CodePen!

That many people have pitched themselves against the HTML Standard (and likely had their head in their hands at least once).

It never fails to surprise me the [places that have featured](/blog/html-memory-tested/) the tricky test:

* People sharing their score and forgotten tags on social media. This viral effect probably accounts for many views.
* Several web newsletters I subscribe to: CSS Tricks, Web Weekly and Front-end Focus.
* Featured in the HTMHell Advent Calendar behind door #5.

## HTML tags to test you

Valid, well-structured HTML is important. How many tags do you know?
