Another year of web work and projects. Let's review my progress.

## PFD

Not so much work here on <abbr>PFD</abbr> this year, just finessing. 

* CSS slimming via CSS nesting, `light-dark()` colours and a print stylesheet replacing a media query.
* [HTML Memory Test](/blog/html-elements-test/) was posted to [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40968520) (homepage), then featured on the CodePen homepage and soon passed a [Hundred Thousand HTML Tests](/blog/100k-html-tests/)!
* See what my first portfolio looked like - I added a screenshot to my [Early Days](/blog/early-days/) post. 

## Side Projects

I've been working to finish these projects and cut down some maintenance burden. _I should really stop adding features._

+ [Elitricity app](/blog/elitricity/)s' background colour changes to the current carbon intensity level (green, amber, red). To improve the app loading experience I added data loading placeholders and static routing API. 
+ [Brush Swap app](/blog/brush-swap/) tweaks to CSS variables, `light-dark()` colours  and `@starting-style` dialog animation. Plus persistent storage to keep your data safe.
+ [Colordinates app](/blog/colordinates/) use of background colour needed `forced-colours` accessibility [fixes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/guide-windows-high-contrast-mode/).
+ Opting out of <abbr>AI</abbr> on _every_ service was a continual side project&hellip; 

Well done for avoiding the <abbr>AI</abbr> [slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slop_(artificial_intelligence)) to get here. Thanks for reading!
