My little [HTML test](/blog/html-elements-test/) really [took off on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22html%20tags%20memory%20test%22). Leslie Cohn-Wein (@lesliecdubs), whose tweet started all this, [retweeted me](https://twitter.com/lesliecdubs/status/1339714662083006464?s=20) to her enthusiastic followers. Next, Manuel Matuzović (@mmatuzo AKA @HTM_Hell), [mentioned it](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo/status/1339907494030811136) and I think it grew from there.

## Reaction

It was unexpected seeing so many people sharing their scores and screen grabs of their ‘tags to recall’. I can see why people build games.

This was my favourite response (and good approach):

## HTML Tags Recalled

Most pleasing, was the number of people mentioning discovering new HTML tags and elements they had forgotten or overlooked before. So the face-palming frustration of this _game_, may have some beneficial effect afterall.

It's quite topical that HTML and it's benefits be shown. There is a recent trend with some of the numerous JS frameworks and web components, where all markup is a `<div>` and we are losing any helpful semantics - a sentiment I saw in some of the tweets. Glad to help shining some light on HTML again.
